# COVID-19-Vaccination-Data-Analysis---India
"This project analyzes India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive (Mar–Jun 2021) using public data. It explores rollout patterns, regional disparities, and daily trends. Insights include registration behavior, government vs. private session distribution, and demographic reach, highlighting the campaign’s effectiveness."


## 📊 Overview

A comprehensive data analytics project examining India's COVID-19 vaccination rollout from March to June 2021. This analysis provides insights into vaccination trends, regional performance, demographic patterns, and infrastructure utilization across government and private healthcare facilities.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Daily Vaccination Trends**: Analysis of day-to-day vaccination patterns and 7-day rolling averages
- **Demographic Analysis**: Gender-wise and age group-wise vaccination breakdowns
- **Infrastructure Mapping**: Government vs. private vaccination site utilization
- **Regional Performance**: Comparative analysis of vaccination speeds across different regions
- **Session Analytics**: Examination of vaccination session efficiency and capacity
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identification of peak vaccination periods and seasonal trends

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and chart generation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
